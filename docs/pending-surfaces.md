# Pending State Surface Catalog

Every user-touchable surface that pends, loads, or auths something.

Status meanings:
- ✅ wired now
- ◐ wired, but intentionally inline/local rather than banner-only
- — intentionally no routine pending surface; keep immediate behavior and surface only real failure

Error action outcomes (standardized in this pass):
- `Try again` = rerun the same user action without a page reload
- `Refresh` = reload the page and re-request app-level truth
- `Open login` = open the login surface when auth is missing or expired
- `Dismiss` = close an informational or recoverable error with no immediate retry path

Notes:
- Recoverable error banners now use only these action labels.
- If a caller does not supply a recovery action, the banner falls back to `Dismiss`.
- Blocking errors still suppress dismiss actions and keep the action locked until the owner resolves them.

## Auth

| Surface | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Login page → **Sign In** button | Supabase signIn | ✅ Inline button state: `Please wait…` during await |
| Login page → **Create Account** button | Supabase signUp | ✅ Inline button state: `Please wait…` during await |
| Sidebar → **Logout** button | Supabase signOut | ✅ Banner: `Signing out…` → recoverable error with standardized actions `Try again` / `Refresh` |
| App cold load (no button) | Session restore on boot | ✅ Delayed boot-scrim copy: `Checking your account…` if auth settle takes long |

---

## Account / Profile

| Surface | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Profile → Account → **Save** (name edit) | `updateDisplayName` | ✅ Inline button state: `Saving…` during await |
| Profile → Account → **Save Password** | `changePassword` | ✅ Inline button state: `Saving…` during await |
| Profile → **Start Chat** button | Intercom `openChat()` | ✅ Inline button state: `Opening…` while widget loads; failure falls back to `Dismiss` |
| Profile → **Share your thoughts** link | Intercom `openFeedback()` | ✅ Inline text swap: `Opening…` while widget loads; failure falls back to `Dismiss` |

---

## Billing & Subscription

| Surface | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Pricing modal → **Free / Choose Pro / Choose Premium** buttons | `fetchPublicConfig` + `fetchRuntimeSnapshot` | ✅ Neutral inline pending: buttons disable to `Loading…` while config resolves |
| Profile → Subscription tab (renders on open) | `fetchRuntimeSnapshot` | ✅ Inline copy: `Checking your account…` / `—` while in flight; the subscription action buttons stay locked as `Checking…` / `Checking billing…` until snapshot truth settles |
| Pricing modal → **Choose Pro / Choose Premium** (signed in) | `POST /api/billing?action=checkout` | ✅ Inline clicked-button state: `Preparing…` + banner: `Preparing checkout…`; error resolves to `Try again`, `Open login` if auth expired, or a Manage Billing steer when a Stripe subscription already exists |
| Profile → Subscription → **Manage Billing** actions | `POST /api/billing?action=portal` | ✅ The hero and overview billing launchers are actionable only when a Stripe customer record exists; otherwise they stay disabled with explanatory copy. When clicked, the tapped button becomes `Opening…` + banner `Opening billing…`; stale auth resolves to `Open login` |
| App returns from Stripe checkout (no button) | Entitlement re-hydration after redirect | ✅ Banner: `Updating your plan…` while policy truth settles; failure resolves to `Refresh` |
| App returns from billing portal (no button) | Billing-status re-hydration after redirect | ✅ Banner: `Refreshing billing status…` while policy truth settles; failure resolves to `Refresh` |

## Usage

| Surface | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Nav → **Usage pill** (renders on auth) | Usage snapshot hydration | ✅ Inline neutral pending: `Checking…` until truth is authoritative |

---

## Importer

| Surface | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Importer → **Scan Contents** button | EPUB parse via JSZip | ✅ Inline button state: `Scanning…` + existing inline step text such as `Reading book…` |
| Importer → **Import** button (post-scan) | `POST /api/content?action=page-break` then IndexedDB write | ✅ Inline progress stage now includes explicit page-builder step before save |
| Importer → **Import** button (non-EPUB file) | Upload → FreeConvert → poll → fetch EPUB → parse | ✅ Existing inline multi-step copy retained (`Preparing upload…`, `Uploading…`, `Converting…`, `Reading book…`) |
| Importer → **Import Text** button | Markdown chapter parse + IndexedDB write | ✅ Inline button state: `Importing…` + progress stage appears before page-break await |
| Importer opens (no button) | `GET /api/app?kind=import-capacity` | ✅ Inline copy while actions are locked: `Checking import availability…` |

---

## Library

| Surface | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard → **Library grid** (renders on auth) | IndexedDB read + remote sync | ✅ In-surface pending remains the primary seam; delayed banner appears only if hydration noticeably stalls |
| Library modal → **Delete** book button | `syncRemoteLibraryItemState` | ✅ Inline button state: `Deleting…` on the clicked row |
| Deleted files modal → **Restore** button | `syncRemoteLibraryItemState` | ✅ Inline button state: `Restoring…` on the clicked row |
| Deleted files modal → **Delete** button | `syncRemoteLibraryItemState` | ✅ Inline button state: `Deleting…` on the clicked row |
| Deleted files modal → **Delete All** button | `syncRemoteLibraryItemState` | ✅ Inline button state: `Deleting…` while batch delete runs |

---

## Reading / TTS

| Surface | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Reading mode → **Play** / `Read page` cloud start | Cloud TTS `POST /api/ai?action=tts` | ✅ No routine pending banner; preserve normal countdown/flow. Surface only real playback errors with `Try again`. Transient cloud/server transport failures must stop cleanly and leave Play immediately retryable. |
| Reading mode → **Skip forward / back** buttons | Runtime route decision | — Intentionally no routine pending state; keep immediate response and surface only real failure |

---

## Settings / persistence

These surfaces use immediate local projection by design. The control should react right away.
Pending UI should not be added to every control.

| Surface group | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Durable synced settings (voice, volume, autoplay, durable theme/font/daily-goal paths) | Queued to durable sync | ✅ Shared failure seam only: banner on sync error — `Your changes weren’t saved yet.` → `Try again` |
| Local-only appearance and Explorer cosmetics that are not durable truth | Local projection | — No routine pending banner |

## Notes locked by this pass

- Button-owned waits prefer inline busy states before any global banner.
- App-level or cross-surface truth settles may use the bottom interaction banner.
- Skip controls remain immediate; adding routine pending there would mask a deeper runtime issue.
- Settings stay optimistic/local first; the shared save-failure seam is enough for this pass.
- Recoverable error banners now standardize to `Try again`, `Refresh`, `Open login`, or `Dismiss`.
